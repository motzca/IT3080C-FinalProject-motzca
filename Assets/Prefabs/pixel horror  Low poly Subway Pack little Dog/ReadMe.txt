 the controlers just someting simple to help testing  just drag and drop the player holder in the stage and your ready to go
hopefully at some ponit i'll put up a few  tutorials to help  make a better controler if you need a hand 
the little dots blank but its set  up so you can pant it eny clour by putting a new Material on it 
fixtures has lights and  columns   in it 
some of the objects are alternative skined objects so not all the props are in the demo 
have fun
